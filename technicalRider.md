=========================================

\underline{Band members:}

| Name  | Role                  |
|:------|:----------------------|
| Joe   | Drums & AV Tech       |
| Allan | Synth, Bass & AV Tech |

Input list
----------

SuperLimitBreak can run their performance in two different configurations.
In one configuration the cubase machine provides the full mix to the desk,
in the other the cubase machine provides separate audio stems to the desk.

These setups are normally chosen between based on the experience of the sound engineer
and technical constraints that may appear throughout the setup process.

\underline{Cubase full mix:} (5 x XLR)

| No | Type | Role                          |
|:---|:-----|:------------------------------|
| 2  | XLR  | Stereo Mix                    |
| 1  | XLR  | Backup Acoustic Guitar 1 DI  |
| 1  | XLR  | Backup Acoustic Guitar 2 DI  |
| 1  | XLR  | Backup Microphone             |


\underline{Cubase stems:} (16 x XLR)

| No | Type | Role                          |
|:---|:-----|:------------------------------|
| 2  | XLR  | Stereo Drum Mix               |
| 2  | XLR  | Stereo Guitar 1 Mix           |
| 2  | XLR  | Stereo Guitar 2 Mix           |
| 2  | XLR  | Stereo Vocal Mix              |
| 2  | XLR  | Stereo Synth Mix              |
| 1  | XLR  | Stereo Bass Guitar Mix        |
| 2  | XLR  | Stereo Backing Audio Mix      |
| 1  | XLR  | Backup Acoustic Guitar 1 DI  |
| 1  | XLR  | Backup Acoustic Guitar 2 DI  |
| 1  | XLR  | Backup Microphone             |

In both cases a set of acoustic DIs and a backup microphone will be required. In the event
of a tech failure during the set, Allan and/or Joe will be required to reboot the equipment on stage.
To make this process as seamless as possible, Lyle & Matt will play some acoustic songs to cover the
time. This is the purpose of the 2 DIs and backup microphone that by-passes our entire tech stack.

Performance Requirements
------------------------

### Backline

- 1x 20amps of uk single phase stage power on a mains plug strip
  (pure sine not modified square wave)
- 2x Guitar DI box

### Frontline
\underline{Monitoring:}

SuperLimitBreak use their own in-ear-monitoring system and do not require foldback monitors.
However a talk to stage system to allow the sound engineer and the band to converse would
aid during the setup process.

\underline{PA system:}

SuperLimitBreak can provide their own PA system provided the audience size is minimal (<120 people).

For larger audiences the venue is expected to either provide (or rent at their own expense) a PA system
that matches or exceeds the following specs.

- Minimum of a 3-way system (high,low & subs)
- Can provide 96dB(spl) at the centre of the audience. Reasonable steps should
  be taken to ensure an even coverage across venue with minimal harmonic and phase
  distortion.
- For larger rooms and audiences, delay fills will be necessary. Please ask for
  details on this if assistance is required to configure this system.
- Appropriate hardware for tuning the PA should be provided (e.g. Graphic Eq
  with a minimum of 31 bands, adjustable delay boxes for each delay fill).
- Ability to record the FOH mix is desirable. Bonus points for discrete
  channels.

SuperLimitBreak can provide consultation on selecting and configuring an acceptable system.

### Staging

SuperLimitBreak require a minimum of 6m x 3m (width x depth) of stage space.
This is due to the lighting rigs used during the performance.

### Lighting

SuperLimitBreak have enough lighting to run a performance, however venues are welcome to
add to this if able to. A desirable feature would be to have an engineer controlled hazer
that could be monitored during the performance for appropriate smoke volume.

It is important for venues to note however that two projection surfaces are used during the show.
These should be kept as clear as possible from any incident light sources and can limit the
placement of stage lighting.
